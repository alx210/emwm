BUILDING AND INSTALLING
=======================
To modify installation prefix and other options, edit the target platform
specific makefile in the mf subdirectory: mf/Makefile.<platform name> (The
target platform name is picked from uname(1)).

Run 'make' in the top-level directory of the source distribution.
When the build process finishes, run 'make install' as root.

CONFIGURATION
=============
The app-defaults file installed in PREFIX/X11/app-defaults/Emwm includes basic
font and color configuration for window decorations. See emwm(1) Component
Appearance Resources section for more information.

A sample emwmrc, which defines key bindings and root/window menus, is installed
in PREFIX/X11/system.emwmrc. This file may be copied to $HOME/.emwmrc for
customization. The emwmrc(4) man-page describes the syntax in detail.
