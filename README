Motif 1.1 Window Manager Status (11 May 90)

*** Mwm 1.1 BETA + +   Notes ***

This snapshot of mwm is composed of files that have changed since betaPlus.


The following are new since the last tape:

    * Mwm now checks that an icon is visible before posting
	a menu for an icon in the icon box.  This needs more
	tuning.

    * Opaque moves can now be canceled safely

    * Mwm now restores client X borders on quit and restart.
	Unfortunately this has introduced a bug on restart
	with regard to the window position when 
	positionIsFrame: True.
	This will be fixed soon.

    * Mwm now removes a terminal separator on a menu if
	the last menu button is disabled via clientFunctions.

    * Active label flashing bug in pointer mode is fixed

    * Misc bug fixes
