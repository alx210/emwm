EMWM - WSM Branch Readme
-------------------------
Restoring the Workspace Manager/Virtual Desktop support that originally
appeared with Motif 2.0 release, and became dysfunctional in 2.1

This is mostly the original implementation, with all external dependencies
removed, and the simple EWMH interface attached to it. The aim for this branch
is to make it the master, once it's considered stable enough.

Note that due to many changes to the code, and only mandatory testing done,
it's not recommended for everyday use yet.

See the INSTALL file for prerequisites and build instructions.

The documentation hasn't been updated to reflect the changes yet, but here are
a few pointers to get it working...

RC Files
----------
EMWM 1.3 configuration files in /etc/X11/system.emwmrc and ~/.emwmrc will
interfere with the workspace functionality, since they don't have any bindings
(window and root menu) defined for it. The repository includes an updated
configuration file "src/system.emwmrc" which should be used instead.

X Resources
-----------
Emwm*workspaceCount: <integer>
Specifies the number of workspaces to create.

Workspaces are referred to as Emwm*ws<number>, while number is the zero based
workspace index. That is, "Emwm*ws0*image: backdrop.xpm" will set the backdrop
image for the first workspace, while "Emwm*ws0*color: olivedrab" sets its
background color.

Key Bindings
------------
There is no workspace switcher, but here are sample bindings for the root menu,
which include Previous/Next commands as well as a sub-menu for direct switching:

Menu DefaultRootMenu
{
    "Main Menu"         f.title
    "New Xterm"         f.exec "xterm &"
     no-label           f.separator
    "Shuffle Up"        f.circle_up
    "Shuffle Down"      f.circle_down
    "Pack Icons"        f.pack_icons
     no-label           f.separator
    "Prev. Workspace"   f.prev_workspace
    "Next Workspace"    f.next_workspace
    "Go To Workspace"   f.menu WorkspaceList
     no-label           f.separator
    "Restart..."        f.restart
    "Quit..."           f.quit
}

!! Sub-menu for "Go To Workspace"
Menu WorkspaceList
{
    "Workspace I"   f.goto_workspace ws0
    "Workspace II"  f.goto_workspace ws1
    "Workspace III" f.goto_workspace ws2
    "Workspace IV"  f.goto_workspace ws3
}

!! Window Menu with workspace switching bindings
Menu DefaultWindowMenu
{
	Restore		_R	Alt<Key>F5	f.restore
	Move		_M	Alt<Key>F7	f.move
	Size		_S	Alt<Key>F8	f.resize
	Minimize	_n	Alt<Key>F9	f.minimize
	Maximize	_x	Alt<Key>F10	f.maximize
	Lower		_L	Alt<Key>F3	f.lower
	no-label				f.separator
	"Occupy Workspace..."	_O	Alt<Key>F2 f.workspace_presence
    "Occupy All Workspaces"	_A	f.occupy_all
    "Unoccupy Workspace"	_U	f.remove
	no-label				f.separator	
	Close		_C	Alt<Key>F4	f.kill
}
